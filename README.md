# Flowmodoro Timer
A simple Flowmodoro Timer built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Motivation
Unlike a Pomodoro Timer, Flowmodoro is more flexible. It can be adjusted to your individual and varying focus duration for increased Flow and deep work. 

## Features
- Start/pause your focus session
- Automatic break calculation: break time = 1/3 of total focus time
- Reset timer to clear back to 00:00:00
